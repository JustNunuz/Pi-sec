# Raspberry Pi Pico W Projects

![Repo Cover Image](/assets/pi.jpeg)

This repository is dedicated to my projects on the **Raspberry Pi Pico W**, which I received at PyCon ZA 2024. Each project explores different functionalities of the Pico W, and more projects will be added as I continue experimenting.

## Projects

- **Blink.py**  
  A basic script that makes an LED blink, ideal for testing initial setup and GPIO capabilities. The code works by making the onboard LED blink a specified number of times.

- **Connect_Disconnect.py**  
  Demonstrates how to connect and disconnect the Pico W from a Wi-Fi network programmatically.

- **News_poster**  
  Scrapes news headlines from a simple webpage (currently limited to Y Combinator news) and displays it via the terminal. This project requires network connectivity and a valid API key.

- **Web_Server.py**  
  Turns the Pico W into a simple web server, allowing users to interact with the device over a network. This server lets users manually turn the LED on or off and check temperature readings.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi Pico W**
- **LED** (optional for Blink.py)
- **Wi-Fi connection** (required for network projects)

### Setup

1. Ensure your Raspberry Pi Pico W is connected and set up for programming.
2. Follow [this guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico) if youâ€™re setting up the Pico for the first time.

## Usage

Each script is standalone and can be run directly on the Pico W. Follow the comments within each file for specific instructions.
